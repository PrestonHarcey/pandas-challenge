Observation 1: 
From the data provided it seems as if spending more money has no direct effect on a school performing better. 
Using only this data, one could assume it, in fact, has the opposite effect. I would argue that size is actually the 
primary contrubituting factor as only 3 of the large sized schools had overall grade averages that could be considered passing.
Overcrowding classrooms and need for extra room/activities/materials greatly increase the cost per student when you have less one on 
one interaction. This rivaled with the amount of control a smaller school can have over its students, the numbers start to make more sense.

Observation 2:

The greater anomoly here if one was not familiar with charter schools would be the efficiency of them.
in terms of the greatest return on investment from a birds eye view, its undeniable that charter schools more 
efficiently use that dollar to make direct impact upon the grades. The efficiency shown here could also be 
skewed due to 2 of these charter schools being in the smaller catagory, but I find the evidence compelling.
